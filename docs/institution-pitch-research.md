Pitching for Institutional Banking Relationships in Australia

(Big Four Banks’ Approach and Global Best Practices)

Introduction

Australian “big four” banks – Westpac, NAB, CBA, and ANZ – all have dedicated corporate and institutional banking divisions focused on servicing large institutional clients (major corporations, government agencies, financial institutions, etc.). Winning a new institutional banking relationship (or mandate) is a significant undertaking: these relationships are typically long-term and “sticky,” so clients do not switch banks often ￼. This means banks invest substantial time and effort into pitches and proposals to institutional clients. This report provides a comprehensive overview of how Australian banks pitch for institutional clients’ business, covering:
	•	Initiating engagement and prospecting for new institutional clients.
	•	The engagement process leading up to a mandate or service agreement.
	•	Details of the pitch and closing process (from proposal to signed agreement).
	•	How pitches take place (in-person meetings, virtual presentations, formal RFP responses, etc.).
	•	Who participates in these pitches from the bank’s side.
	•	The typical structure and content of a pitch deck, including preparation and research.
	•	Relevant global best practices in institutional client pitching (from leading international banks) that Australian banks like Westpac or its peers often emulate.

Throughout, we include examples, survey findings, and case insights to illustrate real-world practices.

Initiating Engagement with Institutional Clients

Winning an institutional client often begins long before any formal RFP or mandate. Banks typically proactively identify and cultivate relationships with target clients well in advance of a pitching opportunity. As one banking executive noted, “You can fill in as many 300-question RFPs as you like, but you won’t win anything without a relationship with the client” ￼. In practice, Australian banks initiate engagement in several ways:
	•	Relationship Managers (RMs) Prospecting: Each major bank assigns senior relationship managers or client coverage teams to specific industries or client segments. These RMs network within their sector, track target organizations, and seek introductions or meetings. Banks often leverage their existing contacts (e.g. board connections, industry events, alumni networks) to get an initial meeting. The goal is to start building familiarity and trust before any formal tender. Indeed, global experts emphasize that “the relationship has to be built before the RFP is received. Winning the business is about human relationships… we would not do a cold pitch” ￼. Australian banks echo this sentiment – for example, NAB was recently ranked #1 by large corporates for having the most capable and trusted relationship managers in the market ￼, reflecting how critical strong RMs are to initiating and maintaining client engagements.
	•	Leveraging Referrals and Networks: Banks often get leads through referrals from existing clients or partners. An institutional client’s ecosystem (suppliers, subsidiaries, peer companies) can provide inroads. John Campbell, Global Head of Sales Management at ANZ, advises that “when trying to build up the relationship it can help to leverage off other existing clients. Their experiences can help to sell the business on your behalf.” ￼ In other words, a satisfied corporate client might recommend their bank to a peer, or a company’s advisor might suggest inviting a certain bank. Australian banks actively cultivate such referrals – for instance, if Westpac successfully banked one infrastructure project, they might use that success story to approach another sponsor in the same industry.
	•	Thought Leadership and Insights: Another common engagement method is providing value-added insights before any transaction. Banks host industry seminars, issue research (e.g. Westpac’s “Westpac IQ” insights portal ￼), and send senior economists or product specialists to share market updates with prospective clients. By acting as a trusted advisor early on (even informally), banks demonstrate their expertise and commitment. This soft approach often opens doors. Westpac, for example, emphasizes an “industry specialist” model, pairing clients with bankers who deeply understand their sector and can unlock opportunities collaboratively ￼. Providing tailored data or advisory (such as benchmarking a company’s metrics against peers) is a best practice many banks use to spark interest ￼.
	•	Initial Services or Trial Transactions: Sometimes, banks will begin with smaller engagements to prove their capabilities. This could mean participating as a minor lender in a syndicated loan, acting as co-manager on a bond issue, or handling a one-off FX transaction. By gaining a toehold in this way, the bank establishes a track record and builds relationships with the client’s treasury team. Australian banks often use this strategy – for example, ANZ or CBA might join a syndicate primarily to get into the conversation for a broader banking role later. Even if these initial transactions are low-profit, they are seen as an investment in the relationship. In cases where a bank bids for a mandate but loses, it may still mark the start of a relationship: “A relationship can start with a lost RFP… if you made a good impression, when the corporate looks for new services you stand a much better chance [next time]” ￼.
	•	Responding to Requests for Proposal (RFPs): While proactive outreach is ideal, banks also engage when a prospective client initiates contact, often via a formal RFP for banking services. Many large companies periodically issue RFPs to review their banking arrangements (nearly 50% of corporates surveyed had sent out an RFP in the past year to re-evaluate bank relationships ￼). If Westpac or NAB is invited to an RFP, it indicates the client considers them a viable partner. Even at this stage, relationship-building matters: Corporates often give incumbent or previously-known banks a slight edge. In fact, treasury consultants recommend having pre-RFP conversations with candidate banks so they understand the company’s needs before they craft their proposals ￼. Engaging with the client’s team during the RFP preparation (within the boundaries allowed) can help the bank tailor its pitch more effectively.

In summary, early engagement is critical. Australian banks initiate contact through dedicated RMs, networking and referrals, thought leadership, and occasional opportunistic deals. The common thread is building familiarity and trust ahead of the formal pitching process. By the time a company is ready to choose a banking partner, the goal is that Westpac, CBA, NAB or ANZ already knows the client well (and vice versa), positioning the bank favorably for the upcoming pitch.

Engagement Process Leading to a Banking Mandate

Once initial contact is made and interest established, the bank and prospective client enter a courtship period that leads up to signing a mandate or banking agreement. This process can unfold over months (or even longer) and involves multiple steps to align on the scope of the relationship. The table below outlines a typical engagement pipeline from first interaction to mandate signing:

Stage	Description & Activities
1. Initial Meeting	The bank’s Relationship Manager (and possibly a small team) meets the client’s CFO or Treasurer for an introductory discussion. The bank listens to the client’s needs and pain points, and gives a broad overview of relevant capabilities. This meeting is about establishing rapport and identifying opportunities. Often, bankers come prepared having researched the client’s industry, recent financial reports, and public statements to better understand the client’s strategy.
2. Needs Assessment & Exploration	Following the initial meeting, the bank conducts deeper research and due diligence on the client. Internally, the RM will assemble a working team (product specialists, credit analysts, etc.) to analyze where the bank can add value. There may be follow-up calls or workshops with the client’s treasury team to gather detailed requirements. For example, if the client is seeking improved cash management, the bank’s transaction banking experts will map the client’s current setup and challenges. This phase is highly consultative – the bank aims to “put itself in the customer’s shoes” ￼ and often uses client data (if available) to quantify potential solutions. The outcome is a clearer picture of which services/products the client might mandate.
3. RFP or Proposal Request	In many cases, especially with large corporates or government agencies, a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued at this stage. The RFP document can be extensive – often hundreds of detailed questions covering everything from pricing, technology, implementation, to risk management ￼. Corporates use RFPs to compare banks objectively. If no formal RFP, the client might still request a written proposal or term sheet from the bank for the desired services. Either way, the bank now enters a more formal competitive process and must prepare a comprehensive pitch.
4. Internal Preparation & Pitch Development	The bank marshals its resources to craft a compelling proposal and pitch deck. This involves answering RFP questionnaires meticulously and developing a presentation tailored to the client. Banks like CBA and Westpac have internal RFP/pitch teams to support RMs in this process – they maintain content libraries of past proposal answers and coordinate input from various product departments (loans, markets, payments, etc.) ￼. Senior product heads and risk managers ensure the proposed solution is viable and priced correctly. The bank’s team also formulates a strategy: identifying its key differentiators for this client, gathering client-specific insights (e.g. benchmarking the client’s financial metrics against peers ￼), and selecting relevant case studies or references to include. This stage is iterative and may include Q&A exchanges with the client – most RFP processes allow banks to submit clarification questions, though all bidders receive the same information in fairness ￼. The output of this phase is a written proposal and a pitch presentation deck ready for delivery.
5. Pitch Presentation (“Beauty Parade”)	Next comes the formal pitch meeting. If an RFP was issued, the client will typically shortlist a few finalist banks (perhaps 2–5) to present. These pitch presentations are often scheduled back-to-back on the same day ￼ – a process informally known as a “beauty parade.” The bank’s senior team travels to the client’s offices (or connects via video conference) to present their proposal and value proposition (more on pitch format and content in later sections). This meeting is the bank’s chance to stand out and make an impression beyond the written RFP responses. Creative touches and personalized messaging are used to make the pitch memorable ￼ ￼. The client’s selection committee (CFO, Treasurer, finance and procurement staff) will probe the bank’s team with questions during and after the presentation.
6. Evaluation and Negotiation	After all pitches, the client evaluates the proposals. They will weigh qualitative factors – solution fit, relationship comfort, service quality – alongside pricing. (Pricing is often critical; one survey noted formal tenders might weight 40% products/services, 40% price, 20% other factors (including CSR) ￼.) Clients may engage in follow-up meetings or calls to clarify outstanding points or to negotiate terms. For example, the corporate might ask Westpac to sharpen its pricing on transaction fees, or seek assurance from NAB on implementation support. If multiple banks are very close, a second round “best and final offer” could be requested, or specific elements (like credit facilities) negotiated separately. Senior executives from the bank often get involved at this stage to authorize concessions and show commitment – it’s not uncommon for a bank’s Institutional Banking head or even CEO to call the client to reinforce how much they value the prospective partnership (especially for a marquee client).
7. Mandate Award and Onboarding	Finally, the client awards the mandate – choosing one or sometimes multiple banks for different roles. The bank and client then sign the agreement(s): this could be a service contract (for cash management or custody, etc.), a mandate letter (in the case of financing deals), or a broader master banking agreement for multi-product relationships. There is often an onboarding or implementation project to transition accounts, migrate transaction flows, set up credit facilities, etc. A successful pitch thus transitions into a delivery phase. Banks strive to execute this onboarding smoothly, as a positive experience now will “stick” the client to the bank. (Indeed, given the effort required to switch banks, a well-executed mandate can last many years ￼.) Even after winning, the bank’s team will conduct a post-mortem internally to note what pitch elements worked well and ensure any promises made are fulfilled to the client.

This end-to-end process from initial engagement to signed mandate can stretch across several months to a year ￼. For example, a corporate might issue an RFP in January, hear pitches in March, finalize choice by May, and complete legal onboarding by mid-year. Throughout this journey, maintaining a strong relationship and frequent communication is vital. The bank that stays close, demonstrates genuine understanding, and adapts to the client’s feedback will have an edge in ultimately securing the mandate.

The Pitch and Closing Process in Detail

The heart of winning an institutional banking relationship lies in the pitch and closing phase – essentially, how the bank convinces the client in the final stretch and seals the deal. This phase is equal parts substance and presentation. Key aspects include:
	•	Customization and Client Focus: By the time of the pitch presentation, successful banks deeply tailor their proposal to the client’s situation. Generic pitches rarely win; institutional clients can sense when a deck is a templated “cut and paste.” Australian banks therefore invest in showing they understand the client’s business and objectives. This might mean citing the client’s strategy or using their terminology in the presentation. As one pitch expert noted, “Personalising the pitch goes further than putting the brand logo on the slides… Creating something the company can relate to will help forge the relationship.” ￼ ￼. In one creative example, Lloyds Bank tailored all pitch materials for a postal services company in the form of postcards and letters carrying key messages, a quirky idea that resonated with the client’s own business theme ￼. Australian banks similarly try to inject client-specific elements – e.g. if pitching to a retail conglomerate, the bank might present data on retail sector trends and even design the deck in the client’s corporate colors and style for familiarity ￼.
	•	Team Composition and Delivery: The presentation team from the bank is carefully chosen (see next section for typical participants). In the pitch meeting, each member has a clear role. Generally, the senior banker or relationship manager will open by reaffirming the bank’s commitment to the client and summarizing the proposal’s high-level benefits. Product specialists then dive into details of the solution (cash management, financing, risk management, etc.), demonstrating how it meets the client’s specific requirements. Throughout, the tone is consultative rather than a hard sell – bankers are encouraged to engage in dialogue, asking if the client’s team has questions or if the proposal aligns with their vision. A best practice is to “put yourself in the customer’s shoes” and pitch “driven by the customer’s needs rather than the bank’s capabilities.” ￼ This approach, as one global banker from DBS describes, is like virtually walking through the client’s journey and framing the bank’s services as answers to the client’s problems ￼.
	•	Making an Impact – Differentiation: In a competitive pitch, all banks will cover the basics; the winner is often the one that leaves a lasting positive impression. Thus, closing a deal often comes down to a bank’s differentiators. Common ways Australian (and global) banks differentiate in final pitches include:
	•	Insights & Benchmarking: Providing valuable insight that the client hasn’t heard from others. For instance, Deutsche Bank established a “global solutions” team that compiles public data to benchmark clients against their peers and identify improvement areas – this allows their pitches to include tailor-made suggestions backed by data ￼. A bank might tell a client, “We analyzed 20 of your global peers and found your cash conversion cycle is longer than most – our solution could help free up working capital,” demonstrating proactive insight.
	•	Credentials & References: Banks highlight their track record and bring references. Institutional clients often ask, “Which similar companies have you served and what have you achieved for them?” If NAB can cite ten similar clients for whom they delivered successful outcomes, whereas a competitor can only cite two, it strongly boosts NAB’s credibility ￼. Banks may even arrange for a reference call or include a letter of endorsement from a well-known client (with permission). That said, there is a balance – pitches should show confidence but avoid boastfulness or irrelevant bragging ￼.
	•	Senior Commitment: Having high-ranking executives present or visibly backing the pitch can differentiate a bank. Clients take it as a sign that they will be an important client to the bank. It’s not unusual for a Big Four bank’s executive (such as the Head of Institutional Banking) to join the pitch meeting for a key account, or at least to personally reach out during negotiations. This assures the client that they will receive attention at the highest level. For instance, Westpac might mention that its CEO is aware of and supports the proposal for a large government client, signaling the bank’s commitment.
	•	Relationship Approach: Banks often explicitly discuss “how we will work with you.” This includes introducing the coverage team (relationship manager and support staff) who would service the account, outlining a service model (e.g. quarterly strategic review meetings, dedicated customer support contacts, etc.), and emphasizing cultural fit. Australian banks trade heavily on being “relationship banks.” A recent survey found NAB rated #1 in Australia for Relationship Strength and trusted advice, which NAB attributed to its “dedicated bankers focused on providing support and building deep relationships” rather than just pushing products ￼. In pitches, NAB and peers underscore this relationship-centric philosophy, which many multinational competitors may lack.
	•	Handling Q&A and Objections: After presenting, the bank must adeptly handle questions or challenges from the client. Common questions might include: “How will you ensure a smooth implementation by our deadline?”, “What differentiates your technology platform from others?”, or bluntly “Your fees are higher than Bank X – can you justify this premium?” Bank teams prepare extensively for such Q&A. In fact, practice sessions or mock Q&As are standard in the days before a big pitch. During the meeting, showing honesty and expertise is key. If a question requires a detailed follow-up, the team should commit to a prompt answer post-meeting. It’s also crucial to read the room – if the client seems concerned about a particular point (say, integration with their systems), the team might double back to reassure and perhaps have their technology specialist give more detail. The best pitch teams turn Q&A into more dialogue, using it to further cement the client’s confidence in choosing them.
	•	Closing Tactics: Toward the end of the pitch process, assuming the client is favorably inclined, the focus shifts to closing the deal. Here, competitive pricing and terms come to the fore. Banks know that no matter how excellent the relationship and proposal, being uncompetitive on price can be a deal-breaker: “A bank can be as good at all the other factors as it likes, but if it cannot compete on price, then the presentation team will come away empty handed every time.” ￼. Australian banks often have to sharpen their pencils in the final round – for example, CBA might improve its loan margin offer or Westpac might reduce transaction fees to meet a competitor’s bid. There is also a trend (especially in procurement-led processes) toward sealed-bid pricing to remove any relational bias ￼. This can turn the final stage into a “price shootout,” which banks privately dislike as it commoditizes their services ￼. Nonetheless, banks will comply and may even offer tiered options (a basic package at one price and an expanded service package at a slightly higher price) to give the client flexibility. Another closing tactic is emphasizing the total value the bank can bring. For instance, ANZ might acknowledge it isn’t the absolute cheapest on one component, but highlight that its overall offering (including, say, superior online platforms and local support) provides better long-term value. Additionally, banks consider the lifetime value of the relationship – sometimes bidding aggressively (even at razor-thin margins or a loss leader) for a prestigious client or a client with large deposit balances. As one international banker noted, “if a company has large daily deposits of $1 billion, you can be tempted to offer the services for free” because the ancillary benefits are so high ￼.
	•	Commitment to Execution: A final element of closing the pitch is assuring the client that the bank will deliver on its promises. This often involves outlining an implementation plan (who will lead the transition, what the timeline is) and any support during onboarding (training, integration help). Banks might also discuss how they handle ongoing support and problem resolution. At closing, the client wants to feel that the bank is fully prepared to take on their business with minimal disruption. Stressing a seamless onboarding plan can alleviate the client’s fears of switching. Sometimes banks will bring in their implementation manager or customer service head in late-stage discussions to reinforce this point.

In essence, the pitch and closing process is where the bank must convert all its preparation and relationship equity into a “yes” from the client. It requires nailing the presentation, differentiating convincingly, negotiating wisely, and instilling confidence that choosing this bank is the right decision. Australian banks, known for a consultative and relationship-oriented style, often excel in the qualitative aspects of pitches, while ensuring their pricing and products remain competitive. By the end of this phase, if successful, the bank and client have aligned expectations and are ready to embark on a new partnership, formalized by the mandate or contract signing.

Pitch Formats: In-Person Presentations, Virtual Meetings, and RFP Responses

The format and medium of pitches for institutional mandates can vary, but certain practices are common:
	•	In-Person Presentations: The traditional and still preferred mode for major pitches is an in-person meeting. There is simply no substitute for face-to-face interaction when trying to build trust and read the client’s reactions in real time. Australian banks often send a team to the client’s boardroom or invite the client’s team to the bank’s offices or an off-site venue for a formal presentation. In-person pitches allow for richer communication; the bank’s team can showcase not just slides but also demos (e.g. walking through an online banking platform on a screen), hand over tailored print materials, and engage in sidebar personal conversations before/after the formal meeting. Body language and personal chemistry often influence the client’s impressions. For these reasons, Westpac, CBA, NAB, and ANZ strongly favor in-person pitch meetings for significant deals – especially now (2025) that travel and meetings have normalized after the pandemic disruptions. During such meetings, banks take care of even small details: e.g. ensuring the room setup is professional and even minding the catering. A famous cautionary tale in banking circles recounts how one bank’s pitch to Coca-Cola went awry when a refreshment trolley arrived stocked with Pepsi bottles, much to the team’s horror – a senior banker swiftly wheeled it out before the client noticed ￼. The lesson: when pitching in person, everything visible to the client (even the coffee served!) should align with the client’s context to avoid distractions or faux pas.
	•	Virtual Meetings: In recent years, virtual pitch meetings (via WebEx, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, etc.) have become more common, whether due to travel limitations or client preference. Virtual pitches have some advantages – they can be scheduled more flexibly, allow involving experts from across the globe easily, and save time/cost. Australian banks leveraged virtual pitches during COVID-19 and continue to use them when an in-person meeting isn’t feasible (for instance, if an Australian bank is pitching an institutional client based overseas, the first round might be virtual). However, virtual formats require extra attention to engagement and technology. Slides need to be even more clear and concise (as video audiences have shorter attention spans), and teams must practice with the platform to avoid technical glitches. A humorous example illustrates the perils: a bank did a client pitch on WebEx with an open chat window – the bankers’ private side conversation was visible to the client on-screen, fortunately caught just in time ￼. The takeaway is that when pitching virtually, discipline and technical know-how are essential. Many banks now treat virtual pitches as seriously as in-person, sending the materials in advance and even shipping physical copies or samples to the client so they can tangibly follow along during the virtual meeting. The format of a virtual pitch generally mirrors an in-person presentation in content, but bankers may incorporate more digital elements (like interactive screen-sharing of a demo, or polling questions) to keep it engaging.
	•	Written RFP Responses and Follow-Ups: In formal procurement processes, a significant portion of the “pitch” happens in writing. Banks must submit detailed written RFP responses by the deadline, which often precedes any oral presentation. These documents can be very extensive – it’s not uncommon for an RFP to include 200–300 questions covering all aspects of the bank’s offering ￼. Australian banks have entire teams (sometimes called proposal teams or RFP units) dedicated to producing these high-quality response documents, ensuring every question is answered completely and compliant with instructions. The writing style needs to be clear and concise – some corporates even impose character limits per answer, forcing banks to be “sharp and to the point to get the message across.” ￼. The RFP response usually includes not just narrative answers, but also appendices of technical information, due diligence documents (e.g. the bank’s financial statements, credit ratings, compliance policies), and often a draft contract marked up with any requested changes. These written pitches are crucial because they determine which banks get shortlisted. A bank might have a superb relationship manager, but if their RFP document is sloppy or generic, they may not make it to the presentation stage. Hence, banks invest in polished writing and visual presentation in the written response – often including infographics, client case studies, and well-formatted tables to make the material compelling even on paper.
	•	Interactive Demos and Site Visits: Depending on the service, part of the pitch process might involve demonstrating the bank’s capabilities in action. For example, if the mandate is for a new treasury management system, the bank might arrange a demo of its online portal customized for the client’s data. Westpac or CBA might set up a “sandbox” environment to show how the client’s daily cash reports would look using the bank’s system, giving the client a tangible feel of the user experience. Occasionally, banks also host the client for site visits – such as a tour of the bank’s dealing room or innovation lab – to showcase infrastructure and team culture. This can be especially effective if the client values operational strength; seeing the bank’s command center for payments or meeting the operations team can reassure the client of the bank’s ability to execute. These kinds of sessions typically happen either around the formal pitch meeting day or in a separate due diligence phase for the finalist. Australian banks have leveraged their local presence this way; for instance, NAB might invite a Melbourne-based corporate’s treasury team to visit NAB’s Melbourne dealing floor and meet the broader support team as part of the pitch, underlining the bank’s on-the-ground support.
	•	RFP “Beauty Parade” Logistics: As noted, when multiple banks are pitching, clients often arrange a structured comparison. It’s common for all finalist banks to be given the same format and equal time to present – say, 90 minutes each, back-to-back. The client may provide an agenda or specific questions to address in the presentation. Banks must be mindful of these guidelines. If asked to focus on certain key decision criteria, the pitch should be calibrated accordingly. Deviating too far or running overtime can hurt the bank’s chances. In Australia, it’s typical for large corporates (assisted by treasury consultants or using internal procurement) to hold such disciplined beauty parades so that each bank is evaluated on similar grounds. Banks often get a brief coffee break between sessions; interestingly, they sometimes gain informal feedback (e.g. one bank’s team leaving might pass another in the lobby and pick up on the client’s mood). Despite being competitors, the decorum is professional. Each bank arrives, presents, and leaves without knowing how others are performing – though, given the tight-knit nature of Australian banking, teams often have a sense of their competition’s strengths. Still, a well-run formal pitch process keeps interactions arms-length and focused.
	•	Post-Pitch Negotiation Meetings: If the decision comes down to fine points, additional meetings (in person or virtual) may occur. For instance, a client might ask Westpac to come back for a “best and final offer” discussion. These are typically more informal and focused on clarifications or pricing. They might involve procurement or legal teams to hash out contract details. While not a “pitch” per se, they are part of the overall pitch process and the bank must present well – for example, bringing a senior negotiator who can make on-the-spot decisions about terms.

In summary, pitches typically combine written proposals, live presentations, and interactive demos, adapted to what the client’s process dictates. Australian banks are adept at both formal written responses and personable presentations. The recent rise of virtual meetings has added another modality, which banks accommodate by leveraging technology (with caution to avoid tech snafus). Ultimately, whether in a Sydney boardroom or a Zoom call spanning continents, the bank’s objective is the same: convincingly communicate why it is the best partner for the client’s needs, and do so within the format the client expects.

Participants in Bank Pitches (Who’s in the Room)

Winning institutional mandates requires a team effort, and banks are very deliberate in choosing who represents them in pitches. A typical pitch team for a major Australian bank includes a mix of relationship leaders, product experts, and often top executives. Key participants often are:
	•	Relationship Manager / Coverage Banker: This is usually the “quarterback” of the pitch. The Relationship Manager (RM) – sometimes titled Client Director or Coverage Executive – is the primary point of contact for the client. They typically open and close the presentation, set the agenda, and establish the relationship narrative. Throughout the engagement, the RM coordinates all internal resources. In the pitch meeting, the client will look to the RM as the person who “owns” the relationship. Australian banks put strong emphasis on RM quality – for example, NAB’s relationship managers have been ranked as the most capable in the market ￼. These RMs are seasoned bankers who understand the client’s industry and can speak to broad strategy. In the pitch, after kicking off, the RM might hand off to product specialists for details but will jump in to connect those details back to the client’s big-picture goals. The RM also typically addresses how the bank will service the account day-to-day, outlining the commitment to the client.
	•	Product Specialists / Heads of Product Units: Depending on the scope of services, the bank will include experts for each major product or solution being proposed. Common roles are: a Transaction Banking head or specialist (to cover cash management, payments, trade finance), a Markets or Treasury specialist (to cover foreign exchange, hedging, investment products), and a Lending/Corporate Finance banker (to cover loans, bonds, or advisory services). These individuals might be product heads or senior solution directors within the bank. Their job in the pitch is to present the technical and business details of how the bank’s offering meets the client’s needs. For example, if ANZ is pitching for a multi-country cash management mandate, the Head of Transaction Banking might walk through ANZ’s electronic banking platform capabilities, sweeping structures, and on-the-ground support in each relevant country. Product experts often field detailed questions (“How does your API integration work with SAP ERP?” or “Can you support payments in XYZ currency?”) and need to demonstrate both deep knowledge and flexibility in tailoring solutions. Including these specialists shows the client that the bank has bench strength and that the folks who would actually implement the solutions are part of the conversation, not just salespeople.
	•	Industry or Sector Specialists: Many banks (including Westpac and CBA) have dedicated industry coverage specialists – bankers who focus on sectors like infrastructure, agriculture, resources, real estate, etc. If the client operates in a specialized sector, the pitch team often includes one of these industry experts. Their role is to speak the client’s industry language and cite relevant sector insights. For instance, Westpac might bring its Head of Energy Sector Banking to a pitch for a utilities company. This person can discuss energy market trends, regulatory changes, and how Westpac has solved similar challenges for other energy companies. It reinforces to the client that the bank truly understands their context. Industry specialists often contribute to the content of the pitch deck as well, ensuring the solutions proposed align with industry best practices.
	•	Senior Executives (Sponsor or Champion): To underscore the importance of the client, banks frequently involve a senior executive in the pitch – someone higher up than the day-to-day relationship manager. This could be the State Manager, the Head of Institutional/Corporate Banking, or even a C-suite executive for very large deals. Their presence serves a few purposes: (1) It signals to the client that they are an important prospect (the bank’s leadership is personally invested in winning their business); (2) The executive can offer a high-level vision of the partnership and speak to the bank’s commitment, stability, and strategic alignment; (3) The executive’s authority can expedite any on-the-spot decisions or assurances. For example, if during Q&A the client’s CFO asks, “Would your bank consider extending a multi-year credit line as part of this?” – having the Institutional Banking Head there to respond “Absolutely, we are committed to supporting you, and we can tailor a credit solution as needed” carries weight. It provides comfort that promises made in the pitch have backing from the top. Australian banks often deploy executives regionally – e.g. a General Manager for Corporate Banking Queensland might attend pitches for Queensland-based companies, acting as the local executive sponsor.
	•	Analysts / Support (Silent Participants): In some pitch meetings, banks will have one or two support staff present, such as a junior analyst or an associate who helped prepare the pitchbook, or a technical expert (like an implementation manager or a risk manager) available for niche questions. These individuals typically do not lead sections of the presentation, but they might speak up if a very specific query arises that falls in their domain. More often, they attend to observe and handle any immediate follow-up requests. For instance, if the client asks for a certain data point, the analyst might have it on hand. While not always introduced formally, their presence shows the depth of the team. Banks must manage this carefully – bringing too many people can overwhelm or confuse the client. A rule of thumb is to only include those who have a clear purpose in the meeting.
	•	Presentation Specialist / Facilitator (optional): On rare occasions, a bank might involve a specialist facilitator – for example, someone to run a live demo or a technology showcase, or an outside consultant if demonstrating a particular tool. One example is if a bank uses a proprietary fintech tool during the pitch (such as a simulation of the client’s cash flows). DBS Bank famously used its Treasury Prism simulation tool during a pitch to a logistics company’s CFO, allowing the client to model liquidity scenarios in real-time; this interactive approach directly led to DBS winning a cash management mandate it otherwise might not have ￼. In such cases, a product manager for the tool might co-present to guide the client through the demo. Australian banks too might include tech demo leads if they are showcasing something like a new online portal or an AI-based analytics platform as part of their differentiators.

On the client side, although not explicitly asked, it’s worth noting who banks typically present to: usually the client’s Treasurer, CFO, and their treasury or finance team, and sometimes procurement or operational executives for technology discussions. Knowing the audience composition helps the bank pick the right pitch team. For example, if a client’s IT manager will be in the room, the bank will ensure their head of digital banking can attend to address any IT integration questions.

Coordination among the bank’s team is crucial. Prior to the pitch, the team meets multiple times to rehearse: the RM ensures everyone knows the flow and timing, product specialists align their points to avoid overlap, and they agree on who answers what type of question. Many banks adopt an internal “pitch captain” (often the RM or another senior banker) whose job is to moderate the presentation and ensure the client’s concerns are addressed by the right person.

In Australian big-bank culture, these pitch teams are often cross-functional and come together just for the specific opportunity, then disband back to their regular roles. However, the camaraderie and unified front they display can itself impress a client. If the bankers seem to work well together, the client senses that the bank is coordinated internally, which bodes well for execution. Conversely, any disarray (e.g. team members contradicting each other or not knowing answers) can sow doubt. That’s why banks often have an internal “pitch coach” or utilize their Client Pitch teams (some banks have a dedicated unit to help prepare and polish presentations, as hinted by job postings in the industry ￼) to ensure a smooth performance.

In summary, the bank’s pitch participants typically include the relationship lead, relevant product and industry experts, and a senior executive to sponsor the pitch. Together, they cover all dimensions of the proposal and convey to the client that “this is the team that will serve you.” This combination of expertise, authority, and personal chemistry is carefully balanced to maximize the bank’s chances of winning the mandate.

Structure and Content of a Pitch Deck

The primary visual aid in most institutional pitches is the pitch deck (often in PowerPoint format). This document crystallizes the bank’s proposal into a storyline, typically backed by data and graphics. While each bank will customize the deck for the client, most pitch books follow a similar overall structure to ensure all key points are covered. Below is a breakdown of typical sections in an institutional banking pitch deck and what each contains:

Section	Content and Purpose
Cover Page & Introduction	A polished cover with the client’s name, the bank’s name/logo, the date, and often a tagline or title (e.g. “Building a Banking Partnership with [Client]”). The introduction usually includes a welcome note or remarks by the bank’s team, thanking the client for the opportunity. This sets the stage and signals that the presentation is tailored for the client. It’s often followed by a team slide showing photos/names of the bank’s pitch team and their titles, so the client knows who’s who in the room.
Executive Summary	A concise one- or two-page summary capturing why the bank is the right choice for the client. It reiterates the client’s key objectives (showing the bank listened) and highlights the bank’s main value propositions and proposed solutions. For example: “You seek to streamline your international cash operations and enhance yield on surplus cash – [Bank] proposes a fully integrated solution leveraging our [specific platform], expected to reduce your costs by 20% and improve visibility across 15 countries.” This section essentially answers, “What will you, the client, gain by choosing us?” in bullet points. It may also subtly emphasize the bank’s strengths like credit rating or domestic network if relevant (e.g. noting stability or market leadership as a trust factor ￼).
Client Background & Our Understanding	This section demonstrates the bank’s understanding of the client’s business and needs. It might include a brief overview of the client’s business (often data gleaned from public reports, showcased to prove the bank did its homework) and the current challenges or opportunities the client is facing. Banks often use the information the client provided in the RFP or prior meetings to describe the client’s situation in their own words: “We understand [Client] is undergoing expansion into Asia and is focused on optimizing liquidity across its new subsidiaries.” The bank may include an analysis of the client’s financials or operations (perhaps benchmarking key metrics against industry averages ￼) to highlight areas where the bank can add value. The goal is to make the client feel “this bank really gets where we’re at and where we want to go.” As one expert said, understanding why the client initiated a mandate (the underlying motivation) “will go a long way towards success” ￼ – this section addresses that explicitly.
Proposed Solution & Services	This is the core of the deck – detailing what the bank is proposing. It is often broken into subsections by product or objective. For example, if the pitch is for a full-service relationship, there may be parts on: Cash Management Solution, Financing Plan, Risk Management (FX/hedging) Strategy, etc. Under each, the bank describes specific solutions: e.g. outlining a cash pooling structure, features of the online portal (with screenshots), a proposed credit facility structure, or an implementation timeline. The content is highly tailored: a bank will incorporate the client’s transaction volumes in examples, or show a map of the client’s operating countries with how the bank will cover each. Diagrams and tables are common here – for instance, a diagram of a proposed treasury structure, or a table of how outgoing payments will be handled in each currency. Banks also highlight any unique features of their solution here (for example, Westpac might showcase its DataX analytics service to help the client mine insights from their transaction data ￼). Another increasingly important component is addressing technology integration – outlining how the bank’s systems will integrate with the client’s ERP, and how data/reporting will flow (this speaks to the client’s efficiency goals; as noted, clients expect digital solutions and no cumbersome manual processes ￼). This section is typically the longest and most detailed part of the deck.
Bank’s Credentials & Experience	After proposing what the bank will do, the deck usually reinforces why the bank is qualified to do it. This section covers the credentials, track record, and strengths of the bank relevant to this mandate. It may include: brief stats (e.g. “#1 Transaction Bank in Australia – Peter Lee Survey 2022” or market share data), credit ratings and financial stability of the bank (an important reassurance, as ANZ’s John Campbell noted a strong bank credit rating helps give clients a sense of stability ￼), and case studies of similar clients. For example, CBA might include a case study of how it helped a mining company automate its payments, if pitching to another mining company. The bank might also list awards or independent rankings (such as Euromoney or Greenwich survey results) that show it’s well-regarded in the services being pitched. Importantly, client references or testimonials might appear here – e.g. a quote from a happy client in the same industry. This section essentially builds the client’s confidence that “others like me have succeeded with this bank.” It’s aligning with the best practice that credentials and references can tip the scales in a competitive pitch ￼. However, banks often weave credentials throughout the deck in context, not just isolate them, to avoid appearing too self-focused.
Relationship Team & Service Model	Here the bank introduces who will be handling the client’s account and how. It typically features a relationship team org chart or list, naming the senior relationship manager, key product contacts, and support staff (with locations and contact info). The bank articulates its service model: for example, “a dedicated client service manager will be available for day-to-day inquiries, backed by a 24/7 helpdesk for urgent issues; we will hold quarterly business reviews to ensure we are meeting your needs,” etc. Australian banks often highlight their local presence here: e.g. ANZ might point out it has on-ground teams in each of the client’s key markets, or Westpac might emphasize its “trusted advisor philosophy and coordinated approach” to relationship management ￼. The idea is to reassure the client that post-mandate, the bank will deliver excellent service and not abandon the client after the sales pitch. It links nicely back to the earlier relationship emphasis. Sometimes, this section also touches on implementation support – naming the implementation manager or team that will handle onboarding (to show that readiness is in place).
Commercial Terms (Pricing)	If not handled separately due to RFP rules, the deck will include a section summarizing the pricing and key commercial terms. In many formal pitches, detailed pricing might be in a separate appendix or document (especially if the process uses sealed bids). But often a high-level summary is given: e.g. “Summary of proposed pricing: Transaction fees of $X per item, credit facility at BBSW+Y bps, etc., yielding estimated annual cost savings of Z% for [Client] compared to your current arrangement.” Banks try to frame pricing in terms of value (savings, efficiency gains) rather than just cost. If the bank is not the absolute lowest price, they will use this section to justify the pricing with the superior features or additional services included. Given that price is usually a top factor ￼, this section is critical. Clarity is key – the client should be able to match these terms with the ones in the written RFP response or any term sheet provided. There should be no surprises or hidden fees unmentioned. Sometimes a comparative Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) analysis is shown if the client gave data on current costs, to prove the bank’s proposal is economically attractive.
Risk, Compliance & ESG Commitments	Large clients pay attention to not just what a bank can do, but how it operates responsibly. Many pitch decks include a section on the bank’s risk management and compliance capabilities – for example, how robust their cybersecurity is, or how they ensure continuity of service. Additionally, with the rising importance of corporate responsibility, banks often speak to their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) credentials and alignment with the client’s values. Indeed, corporates increasingly demand banks meet certain ethical criteria and even weight this in scoring decisions ￼. In a pitch deck, a bank might highlight its sustainability initiatives, such as green financing options, community investments, or diversity and inclusion stats, especially if the client has strong CSR goals. Lloyds Bank’s pitch approach noted that even local community projects the bank engages in near a client’s headquarters can help clinch a deal by resonating personally ￼. Australian banks often underscore their community commitment (for example, NAB and Westpac have extensive sustainability reports that can be cherry-picked for relevant points). Including this section shows the bank is not just financially capable, but also a trusted, responsible partner that will enhance the client’s own reputation.
Next Steps & Closing	The final section usually outlines next steps if the client selects the bank. It might list the key steps and timeline for implementation (“Day 1: Mandate signed; Week 1: Kick-off meeting; Month 1-2: account setup and testing; Go-live: Month 3”). This helps the client visualize a smooth transition. The RM or team leader will then make a closing statement, often recapping the main benefits of the partnership and expressing enthusiasm to work together. It’s common to explicitly say, “Thank you for your consideration; we are truly excited about the prospect of partnering with [Client] and are fully committed to your success.” This positive, confident close is important to leave a good final impression. Sometimes banks end on a tagline or a meaningful quote that encapsulates the partnership vision. Finally, the deck will have contact information and an offer to answer any further questions. At this point, the presentation formally ends and the floor opens for discussion.

This structure is flexible; not every pitch deck is identical. For instance, if the pitch is only for a specific product (like just a bond issue or a cash management solution), the deck will focus more narrowly on that. But for broad relationship pitches (which is often the case when competing to be a primary bank), the above elements all usually appear in some form.

Preparation and Research for the pitch deck is an intensive exercise. Banks will typically do the following in preparing the deck:
	•	Client Research: Gather all available information on the client – annual reports, investor presentations, news articles, analyst coverage, and any internal knowledge if the bank has a prior minor relationship (e.g. credit ratings, existing facilities). The aim is to tailor every page of the deck. For example, if the client’s public goal is to digitalize its treasury, the deck will mirror that language and present digital solutions front-and-center.
	•	Benchmarking and Data Analysis: As part of differentiating, banks analyze the client’s data versus peers (if available) ￼. They also use any metrics provided by the client in the RFP (like volumes, interest rates, etc.) to compute potential savings or improvements the bank can deliver. This quantification is powerful in a pitch – e.g., “Our proposal could save you ~A$500k annually in banking fees” or “improve yield by 0.5% on your $200m surplus cash.” Such statements need backup calculations, which the team prepares and often includes in an appendix in case the client’s financial staff want to review the assumptions.
	•	Drafting and Review: The initial draft of the pitch deck is usually prepared by the RM with analysts or associates, filling in standard content from the bank’s content database (most banks have repositories of approved language for describing products, case studies, etc.) which ensures consistency and saves time ￼ ￼. Then it goes through rounds of review with product heads and sometimes a dedicated pitch/proposal unit for polish. Banks like NAB and Westpac have internal teams whose sole job is to refine pitch materials – ensuring messaging is clear and graphics are professional. These teams also enforce compliance (checking no promises are made that violate policy, and all claims are accurate). Senior bankers will review the deck and often conduct a mock pitch practice with the team using the deck to fine-tune the flow and talking points.
	•	Visual Design: A lot of attention goes into the visual appeal of the deck. As noted earlier, banks even tailor the visual design to the client’s brand (fonts, colors, imagery) to make it feel familiar ￼. Charts, infographics, and pictures are used to break up text and communicate key points quickly. For example, instead of a paragraph describing how a cash pooling works, a simple diagram can show the structure. Australian banks have in recent years updated their pitch templates to be more visual and less text-dense, aligning with global trends (no more tiny font 50-page decks – brevity and impact are valued). One international survey humorously noted even Twitter’s influence: some corporates now request very concise answers, effectively pushing banks to present info in a headline style ￼. This carries into the deck design as well – clear section headers, call-out boxes with the main proposal highlights, etc., so that if the client later skims the deck, the key messages pop out.
	•	Compliance and Checks: Before sending the deck to the client (often they request a copy before or after the meeting), the bank will do a thorough check that everything in the deck is accurate and not misleading. All numbers must tie out with any formal term sheets. Any forward-looking statements or “promises” have to be vetted. For instance, if the deck says “We will complete implementation in 8 weeks,” internally the team must be sure that timeline is feasible. This is part of pitch ethics and credibility – one wants to promise attractively, but deliverably. Overpromising and underdelivering is a recipe for a short-lived relationship, which banks avoid. Given the importance of such pitches, final decks often get a sign-off from a risk or compliance officer especially if regulatory or legal assurances are included.

Overall, the pitch deck is both a sales document and a blueprint for the proposed relationship. It needs to tell a coherent story: starting from the client’s needs, presenting the tailored solution, evidencing the bank’s capability to deliver, and concluding with the joint path forward. When done well, the pitch deck not only wins the mandate but also serves as a reference during implementation (since it documents the agreed approach).

It’s worth noting that beyond the deck, banks sometimes leave behind additional materials – e.g. a detailed proposal document or whitepaper – but the deck is the focal point in the live pitch. Australian banks, by aligning their pitch content with global best practices (client-centric narrative, data-backed proposals, and polished visuals), ensure they are competitive against international banks vying for the same mandates.

Global Best Practices and Trends in Institutional Client Pitching

Australian banks like Westpac and its peers don’t operate in isolation – they pay close attention to global best practices in pitching to institutional clients, and often emulate or adapt strategies used by leading banks worldwide. Here we highlight some global best practices in institutional pitching (many already touched on above) and how they manifest in pitches, providing context that Australian banks are part of these trends:
	•	Relationship-First Approach: A universal truth in institutional banking is that strong relationships underpin successful pitches. Global transaction banking heads emphasize that no matter how slick your pitch book is, if you haven’t built a relationship, your chances are slim ￼. This has led banks worldwide to invest in what’s sometimes called “farmer” sales strategies (long-term cultivation), not just “hunter” tactics. Australian banks certainly follow this – they deploy senior RMs to regularly visit clients (ANZ was recognized for having the most frequent and effective client visit program in one survey ￼). The best practice here is consistency: engaging the client well before any RFP, staying in touch through newsletters, quick check-in calls, sharing ideas without waiting for a formal pitch invitation. By the time a mandate opportunity arises, the bank isn’t a stranger but a trusted advisor candidate. This global playbook of patient relationship-building is a hallmark of how Westpac, NAB, CBA, and ANZ manage their top clients and prospects.
	•	Thorough, Compliance-Friendly RFP Responses: On the global stage, banks have developed robust RFP response teams and infrastructures. Best practices include having a central content repository of high-quality answers (so each new RFP doesn’t start from scratch), and an internal process to marshal the right experts quickly for each proposal ￼ ￼. Many leading banks also maintain templates for common pitch sections, which can be tailored per client, ensuring nothing important is overlooked. This trend is visible in Australian banks as well – for instance, job postings at NAB describe roles focused on coordinating RFP responses and pitchbook preparation to support RMs ￼. Additionally, global best practice demands strict adherence to RFP rules: submitting on time, in the format requested, and addressing every question. Banks have lost deals for trivial misses like exceeding a page limit or a formatting error. Thus, discipline and attention to detail in proposal writing is a must – something ingrained in the big banks’ procedures. A banker humorously noted even the character limits some clients impose (influenced by Twitter culture) require being “sharp and to the point” ￼; this has pushed banks to hone clear and concise writing skills as a best practice.
	•	Deep Client Understanding & Customization: Around the world, the best pitches demonstrate almost as much insight about the client as the client has about itself. Banks achieve this by investing in research and analytics tools. One example is Deutsche Bank’s approach of using a specialized team to analyze a client’s public data and benchmark it, which then feeds into a highly customized pitch offering tailor-made solutions ￼. Another example: DBS Bank’s Treasury Prism platform allows a corporate to simulate various banking arrangements; DBS has used insights from that tool to craft pitches that directly address the modeled needs of clients ￼. Australian banks may not have an identical tool to Treasury Prism, but they are increasingly using data analytics to differentiate pitches. For instance, Westpac launched Westpac DataX, a service providing data insights to businesses ￼; in a pitch, Westpac could leverage DataX to show a client trends about their own customer base or supply chain that Westpac can help optimize. Globally, data-driven insights have become a key best practice – rather than just saying “we understand your needs,” banks now bring proof in the form of data analysis, forward-looking projections (e.g. scenario analysis for the client’s expansion plans), and even AI-driven suggestions. This consultative, research-backed approach elevates the pitch from a sales meeting to an advisory session, which clients value highly.
	•	Memorable and Client-Centric Presentation: The best global banks are very savvy about making their pitch memorable in a positive way. This can involve creative marketing techniques: Lloyds Bank’s tailoring of pitch materials to client branding (down to using the client’s own jargon) ￼ and the inventive leave-behind like postcards for a postal company ￼ are prime examples. Such creativity shows the client that the bank went the extra mile and isn’t just regurgitating a standard pitch. We have seen Australian banks adopt similar touches – for instance, if pitching to a tech company, the deck might be designed to look like a tech product launch, or if pitching to a sustainability-driven organization, the bank might deliver the pitch on recycled paper folders or accompanied by a small token like a donation to a charity important to the client. These flourishes must be tasteful and relevant. A global best practice here is storytelling: framing the pitch as a story of the client’s journey and how the bank will partner in that journey. This narrative style (as opposed to just listing services) makes the content more engaging. U.S. and European banks often hire presentation coaches to help teams improve storytelling and engagement – Australian banks too have started focusing on narrative in pitches. For example, ANZ’s institutional division has been noted for its “customer-centric approach” and building a story around client growth in Asia ￼, which feeds into how they pitch solutions as enablers of that growth.
	•	Use of Technology in Pitches: Globally, banks are leveraging technology not just as a talking point, but in the pitch delivery itself. This includes providing interactive demos, as mentioned, or even giving the client a digital version of the proposal (for instance, a secure microsite where the client can explore the proposal components, watch short demo videos, etc., at their own pace). Some banks have experimented with virtual reality or simulations to immerse the client in the scenario of working with the bank. While perhaps not mainstream yet, these innovations show how far banks will go to differentiate. What is mainstream is showcasing the bank’s tech capabilities in the proposal: since many corporates prioritize digital tools (like API banking, mobile dashboards), the pitch needs to convince them the bank is tech-savvy. However, as a best practice, banks focus on how tech solves the client’s problem rather than tech for tech’s sake. Joanne Scheier of BNY Mellon noted that certain tech features are now expected baseline (e.g. a mobile app) and won’t win a deal by themselves ￼. Instead, banks win by demonstrating smarter use of tech and data – for example, showing how they’ll provide data analytics and benchmarking (BofA’s team highlighted that clients want to compare against peers and get insights, not just raw data ￼). In Australia, banks like CBA have invested heavily in digital platforms (CommBank’s online portals, for instance) and will often include a brief live demo or at least screenshots of these advanced tools in pitches, aligning with global standards that tech should be seamlessly integrated into the pitch narrative.
	•	ESG and Values Alignment: As noted, globally there’s a strong trend of incorporating ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) factors into pitches. European banks especially have been leaders in this, given stakeholder expectations there. They bring up topics like sustainable financing options, the bank’s own carbon footprint, ethical policies (like no financing of certain controversial activities), and community involvement. Now, institutional clients worldwide, including in Australia, are explicitly evaluating banks on these factors ￼. Thus, Westpac and peers highlight their values and corporate responsibility in pitches if relevant to the client. For example, if pitching a university (which may care about socially responsible banking), the bank will mention its commitment to indigenous communities or renewable energy financing portfolio. It’s become a best practice to treat ESG not as a niche footnote but as a genuine part of the value proposition – positioning the bank as not only a service provider but a partner that “shares your values and will enhance your corporate responsibility goals.” In fact, a Lloyds banker noted that even small community projects near a client’s HQ can be a “clincher” in building an affinity ￼. Australian banks often have strong local community ties, so they use that to advantage in pitches. For instance, NAB might mention its support for regional agribusiness if pitching to a food processing company headquartered in a rural area, forging a personal connection.
	•	Pricing Strategy and Flexibility: Best practice globally also recognizes that while relationships and solutions are key, pricing remains a critical factor and must be handled strategically. Leading banks approach pricing discussions with flexibility – sometimes offering innovative pricing models (like volume-based tiering, or bundling various fees into one all-in service fee for simplicity). There’s also the concept of cross-subsidization: maybe the bank will price the core service at or below cost but expect to earn revenue on ancillary services once the relationship is in place ￼ ￼. This long-term view is a common practice among global banks, essentially investing in the client. However, banks must be mindful of sustainability; a pure “race to the bottom” on price can backfire if service suffers. Best practice therefore is to be transparent and fair in pricing, and whenever possible, tie pricing to demonstrated value (e.g. outcome-based pricing or showing TCO reduction). In pitches, rather than avoiding the price topic, successful banks address it head-on, explaining how their pricing is constructed and often providing scenarios (like if the client’s volumes grow, how pricing would adjust). This builds trust. In Australia, where the big four have historically enjoyed healthy margins, there is increasing pressure to be price-competitive especially when international banks or smaller players bid aggressively. Thus, Australian banks have sharpened their pricing tactics, taking cues from global banks on how to present a compelling commercial offer without eroding relationship value. For example, they might offer contractual commitments like price reviews or gain-share arrangements if efficiencies are realized, which are concepts borrowed from procurement best practices to show partnership mindset.
	•	Dedicated Pitch Teams and Coaching: Another global best practice is the formalization of the pitch process internally. Many leading banks have dedicated teams (sometimes called “deal teams” or “pitch centers”) that support bankers with everything from research to graphic design. They often maintain the aforementioned content databases and ensure consistency in messaging. Some banks even have internal certification programs for RMs to enhance their consultative selling and pitching skills, often coached by external consultants or using simulations. The presence of a LinkedIn blurb about a “Client Pitch Team” at a major bank indicates that Australian banks too have institutionalized this function ￼. These teams help raise the overall quality of pitches. Best practices from them include conducting win/loss debriefs after pitches to learn what worked or why the bank lost, continuously refining their approach. Over time, these improvements manifest as a more polished and effective pitch strategy for the bank.
	•	Speed and Efficiency: While not explicitly covered earlier, a subtle best practice is responding quickly and efficiently to opportunities. If a corporate hints at interest, the bank that mobilizes a pitch the fastest can impress the client. This doesn’t mean rushing a half-baked proposal, but top banks have enough standardized process to put together a credible initial proposal in days if needed. In dynamic markets or for opportunistic deals (like a sudden acquisition financing need), this agility wins business. Australian banks, being large organizations, can be bureaucratic, but competition (especially from nimble foreign banks or boutique firms) has pushed them to improve speed. For example, having preliminary term sheets ready or quick-access approval for key terms allows an RM to go into a meeting with concrete offers rather than “I’ll get back to you in two weeks.” Globally, banks that empower their front-line teams with guidelines and delegate authority can respond to clients faster, which is a practice Australian banks are adopting under various “simplification” initiatives in institutional banking.

In light of these best practices, Australian banks are continually evolving their pitch techniques. They often benchmark themselves via surveys like Peter Lee Associates or Greenwich which measure how clients perceive their pitches, relationship management, and capabilities. The fact that multiple Aussie banks claim #1 in relationship strength or quality indicates they have been successful in adopting global best practices and localizing them (for instance, ANZ and NAB have each been recognized for relationship strength in recent years ￼ ￼).

Finally, one global trend worth mentioning is the move to more strategic, partnership-based pitches rather than transactional ones. Especially for institutional clients, banks strive to position themselves as strategic partners who will support the client’s growth, not just as vendors of financial services. This consultative stance – sometimes evidenced by bringing ideas like new market entry strategies, introductions to the bank’s network of other clients, or even co-creating solutions with the client – is a cutting-edge practice. Some leading banks hold “ideation workshops” with a client’s team as part of the pitch, which turns the pitch into a collaborative problem-solving session rather than a one-way presentation. This high-engagement model is used by top-tier international banks for key clients. Australian banks, to the extent possible, are beginning to incorporate elements of this (for example, running treasury transformation workshops for a client as part of the courting process, free of charge, to help design the optimal solution). Such efforts strengthen the perception of the bank as a long-term partner.

In conclusion, Australian banks in pitching to institutional clients follow a playbook that is very much aligned with global best practices: a heavy emphasis on pre-existing relationships, meticulous and client-centric proposal crafting, an impressive and tailored pitch presentation, and a balanced offering of competitive economics and value-added insights. By learning from and sometimes partnering with global banks (many Australian corporates also deal with international banks, so the big four see what they’re up against), banks like Westpac, NAB, CBA, and ANZ continuously refine their pitch strategies. The end goal is the same everywhere: win the client’s trust and business by demonstrating you understand them best and can deliver the most value. And as the examples and practices outlined show, it’s as much an art (in presentation and relationship nuance) as it is a science (in analysis and solution design).

Real-World Examples and Case Insights

To illustrate how these processes and best practices play out, it’s useful to look at a few publicly known examples and scenarios:
	•	Case Study: DBS wins Logistics Client Mandate with Digital Tool – A leading Asia-Pacific bank, DBS, provided a vivid example of innovation in pitching. The client, a logistics company, was not initially looking to change its cash management bank. DBS introduced its Treasury Prism digital platform to the client’s CFO, allowing the CFO to model various liquidity management scenarios interactively. This data-driven consultation “sparked a new level of conversation” and convinced the client of DBS’s capabilities, resulting in DBS being awarded a major cash management mandate that the client hadn’t even planned to outsource ￼. This case underscores how introducing a unique value-add (in this case, an analytical tool) during the engagement can create an opportunity and win business. Australian banks have taken note – they are increasingly using fintech partnerships and analytics in their pitches, aiming to similarly change the conversation from just price and basic services to strategic insights.
	•	Case Example: Pitch for a Global Consumer Goods Company (Hypothetical Synthesis) – Consider a scenario pieced together from common practice: A global consumer goods company with regional headquarters in Australia issues an RFP for its banking across Australia/NZ. All four big Australian banks, plus a couple of international banks (say HSBC and Citi), are invited to pitch. Leading up to the RFP, Westpac’s RM has been visiting the company quarterly, providing them with Westpac’s consumer spending reports to help their business – building credibility. When the RFP drops, Westpac quickly assembles a team, uses its content database to answer the 250 RFP questions meticulously (double-checking the character limit on each answer as the RFP dictates concise responses ￼), and highlights its #1 market share in relevant products. It asks clarifying questions through the RFP’s formal Q&A process – though knowing all answers are shared with competitors, they keep questions generic ￼. Westpac and NAB make the final cut. During the pitch presentations, both banks bring their top talent: NAB perhaps brings a slightly higher-ranking executive, Westpac brings a cutting-edge demo of its mobile treasury app. Both have strong relationship narratives (NAB leans on its recent Peter Lee #1 Relationship Bank ranking ￼, Westpac on its longevity and global network in relevant markets). In the end, the client scores them closely, but chooses NAB by a slim margin due to a slightly more aggressive pricing on fees and an excellent reference from another corporate. Westpac, having made a good impression, is gracious in defeat and continues to stay in touch. Eighteen months later, when the company has a problem with one of NAB’s overseas affiliates, they remember Westpac’s global network pitch and bring Westpac in to take over part of the business. This composite example shows how multi-faceted the competition is – any edge (be it relationship, price, or a strong reference) can swing the decision, and how a lost pitch can sow seeds for future business (as SocGen’s banker noted about lost RFPs being a first point of contact ￼).
	•	Public Sector Banking Tender: Public sector mandates in Australia (e.g., the transactional banking for a state government department) are often highly structured. The tender documents are public, and the process is stringent. For instance, Queensland Treasury Corporation’s banking services RFP in the past required detailed answers on everything from security to disaster recovery. Banks like CBA and Westpac, which have government banking teams, responded with painstaking detail and often involved their technology partners. A notable aspect in such public tenders is the weight given to innovation and community benefit. In one case, a bank pitched a solution that included a portal for improved transparency of government transactions, which was a differentiator. Though specifics are often confidential, references in government meeting minutes or award announcements sometimes reveal that, say, “Bank X was appointed due to its superior technology platform and proven implementation track record in similar government agencies.” This affirms the importance of tailored solutions and proven experience in pitches – banks can’t just claim capability; they must evidence it (e.g., citing that they successfully transitioned another large complex client on time).
	•	Use of External Consultants: Sometimes companies hire consulting firms (like the Big 4 or treasury advisory boutiques) to run their bank selection. Those consultants often insist on very formal pitch structures and might score pitches on preset criteria. A best practice in those scenarios – which global banks follow and Aussie banks have learned – is to address every criteria explicitly. For example, if one criteria is “Capability in multi-currency pooling” worth 10%, the pitch deck will have a slide explicitly titled “Our Multi-Currency Pooling Capability” so that the evaluators can easily find and score it. Banks that attempt a more free-form pitch risk not ticking a box in the scoring sheet. By aligning pitch content with the client’s RFP evaluation matrix, banks increase their chances. This somewhat mechanical aspect of pitching is a global reality in consultant-led deals. Australian banks will often ask, during Q&A, for any insight into scoring priorities so they can focus accordingly (sometimes the RFP outright tells the weighting, e.g., 40% price, 40% service, 20% extras ￼ – then banks know how to allocate their pitch emphasis).

In all these scenarios, we see a blend of the elements discussed: relationships built early, rigorous preparation, client-focused solutioning, team orchestration, and competitive offering, guided by both local knowledge and global best practices.

Conclusion

Pitching for institutional banking relationships is a high-stakes endeavor that combines relational skill, technical know-how, strategic thinking, and polished execution. Australian banks – Westpac, NAB, CBA, ANZ – have honed a pitching approach that is deeply relationship-driven at its core, in line with their ethos of partnership banking. They initiate client engagements proactively, often long before any formal opportunity, ensuring that when the time comes to pitch, they are already a familiar and trusted presence.

The process from engagement to mandate involves careful needs assessment, collaborative proposal crafting, and often a formal RFP response followed by an intensive “beauty parade” pitch presentation. In these pitches, banks mobilize cross-functional teams (relationship managers, product experts, senior executives) to put their best foot forward. The content centers on bespoke solutions addressing the client’s goals, backed by the bank’s credentials, and delivered in a compelling narrative that often mirrors global best practices.

We saw how global banks emphasize things like thorough RFP responses, use of data/tech in pitches, creative tailoring of presentations, and alignment with client values – all of which Australian banks are embracing. Whether it’s leveraging analytics to show a client something new about their business, or making sure to mention the bank’s stance on sustainability, these elements can make a difference in winning mandates. And while pricing invariably plays a pivotal role in the final decision, the bank that consistently wins in the institutional space is the one that manages to differentiate beyond price – through superior insight, reliable execution, and the promise of a genuine partnership.

For institutional clients, choosing a bank is like choosing a long-term business partner. Australian banks understand this, as reflected in comments like “We believe the strength of our relationships is a key driver in enabling our customers to achieve long term success” ￼. Thus, their pitches are not merely sales presentations; they are proposals for alliance. The inclusion of case studies, executive commitment, and a well-structured deck provides the reassurance that the client’s business will be in good hands.

The evolution of pitching techniques will no doubt continue. With trends such as digitalization, data science, and ESG shaping corporate priorities, banks will keep innovating in how they pitch – perhaps using AI to personalize proposals even more, or offering real-time prototype solutions during pitches. Nonetheless, the fundamentals likely remain the same: know your client, show you can meet their needs (and future needs), prove your capability, and connect with them on a human level.

By combining these elements, banks like Westpac, NAB, CBA, and ANZ have secured numerous institutional mandates and will aim to continue doing so in the face of both local rivalry and global competition. The process is demanding and resource-intensive (sometimes taking up to a year from first pitch to first transaction ￼), but the payoff – a deep, multi-year banking relationship – is highly rewarding for both bank and client. In summary, effective institutional client pitching in Australia is a symphony of preparation, personalization, and partnership, all conducted with the client’s success as the focal point.

These illustrate both the common practices and the nuanced strategies that define successful pitches for institutional banking mandates.
